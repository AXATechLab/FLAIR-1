The .ZIP folder predictions_TOY.zip is an example on expected format submission for the FLAIR#1 challenge. 
The folder contains only 50 .tif images corresponding to predictions on the test set of the TOY dataset.
The final submission on Codalab should have the same structure but contain 15,700 .tif images corresponding to predictions on the full test dataset available after registration to the challenge.
